# RMH Mod Sync

**RMH Mod Sync** is a System designed to sync mods between users playing rimworld multiplayer on the [Rimworld Multiplayer Hub](https://discord.gg/ceanhWd3mR).

#### RMH Mod Sync can:

- Remotely Sync Mod lists
- Remotely Sync Mod Configs
- Allows partial syncing (Keeping some mod configs different)

#### RMH Mod Sync has plans to:

- Remotely Send Mod Files
- Local Storage of different configs list. (For quicker accessibility.)

Though, its functionality is universal across all multiplayer servers.

If you need help setting up the server backend, feel free to contact me on Discord JackPrograms(Hashtag)8889.
